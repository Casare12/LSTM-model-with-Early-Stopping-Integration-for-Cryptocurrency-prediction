# LSTM-model-with-Early-Stopping-Integration-for-Cryptocurrency-prediction
Long Short Term Memory models perform better in predicting time series data but the model might overfit the data or underfit it. Early Stopping is one way to deal with this problem. In this project, we demonstrate how the Early Stopping model can enhance model accuracy
